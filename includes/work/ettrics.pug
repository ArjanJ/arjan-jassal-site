        | Ettrics was my first real taste of being a frontend developer on a team with backend engineers
        | and product designers. It was at Ettrics that I started as Web Designer and ended as a Frontend Developer. 
        | The key moment during this evolution was when I picked up <strong>Angular.js</strong>
        | and started to intract with <strong>RESTful APIs</strong> that the backend devs were building.
        | This way of working on the frontend was totally different than the static websites I was used to building, and I loved it.
