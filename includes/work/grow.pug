          | I joined Grow's team of 4 engineers while the company was still focused on a direct-to-consumer model.
          | At the time, Grow's competition was banks and credit unions across Canada. Shortly after joining, Grow pivoted
          | to a SaaS model, and now their competition were customers. This brought a slew of challenges to the
          | engineering team, like making our existing product white-labeled and modular so that it could be highly scalable
          | across all customers. As you could imagine, a lot of discussions around what to refactor to
          | fit this new business model were had, along with what to rewrite from a blank slate and the pros and cons
          | of each option.
        p.work-group-body-copy
          | The next 2 years were spent utilizing <strong>React</strong>, <strong>Redux</strong>, <strong>Styled Components</strong>, and
          | many other great tools in the JavaScript ecosystem to build the UI that powered Grow's
          | modular products. I also helped build out the frontend team by <strong>interviewing</strong> countless candidates
          | and taking part in refining Grow's interview process.
        p.work-group-body-copy
          | Grow also didn't have any product designers, so myself and another frontend engineer designed all
          | products and old marketing websites. This was a fun but challenging responsibilty because we had to
          | thinking about the UX, UI, as well as code, so there was a lot of context switching, but also a lot of
          | valuable experience wearing those different hats.
