        | I joined Taloflow's tight-knit team as their first frontend engineer.
        | Part of my role was to decide what tech to use, how to structure things, and to get an MVP up and running
        | a.s.a.p. Like most startups, trade-offs and prioritization were key when it came to shipping on time.
      p.work-group-body-copy
        | With that in mind, I choose to use tech I was very familiar with like <strong>React</strong>, <strong>Styled Components</strong>, and <strong>Firebase</strong>,
        | and <em>some</em> tech I'd never used but wanted to, like <strong>TypeScript</strong>.
        | This way I could still progress quickly and keep things interesting by learning something new.
