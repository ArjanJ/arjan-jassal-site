              | I joined Taloflow's intimate team as their first frontend engineer.
              | Part of my role was to decide what tech to use, how to structure things, and to get an MVP up and running
              | a.s.a.p. Like most startups, there are tight deadlines, and tight deadlines come with trade-offs.
            p.work-group-body-copy
              | With that in mind, I choose to use tech I was very familiar with like <strong>React</strong>, <strong>Styled Components</strong>, and <strong>Firebase</strong>,
              | and <em>some</em> tech I'd never used but wanted to, like <strong>TypeScript</strong>.
              | This way I could still progress quickly and keep things interesting by learning something new.

              | I joined Grow's team of 4 engineers while the company was still direct-to-consumer.
              | Grow's competition back then was banks and credit unions across Canada. Shortly after joining, Grow pivoted
              | to a SaaS model, and now their competition were customers. This brought many challenges to the
              | engineering team, like making our product white-labeled and modular so that it could be highly scalable
              | across all customers.
            p.work-group-body-copy
              | The next 2 years were spent utilizing <strong>React</strong>, <strong>Redux</strong>, and
              | many other great tools in the JavaScript ecosystem to build the UI that powered Grow's
              | modular product. I also helped build out the frontend team by <strong>interviewing</strong> countless candidates
              | and taking part in refining Grow's interview process.
            p.work-group-body-copy
              | Grow also didn't have any product designers, so myself and another frontend engineer designed all
              | products and old marketing websites. This was a fun but challenging responsibilty because we had to
              | thinking about the UX, UI, and code, so there was a lot of context switching, but also a lot of
              | great experience wearing those different hats.
